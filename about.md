# ✌️ Hi · 你好 · Salut · 今日は
I'm Cary "Cart" Wang, a developer from New York City with a love for languages both computer and human.  When not tinkering with code, I can be found in the great outdoors, hiking and climbing:

I firmly believe that secure, stable, and sustainable practices are applicable both out in the wild and within the digital domain.
